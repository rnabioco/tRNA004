# tRNA004
Nanopore direct tRNA sequencing method refinement and benchmarking of RNA modification detection between old (RNA002) and new (RNA004) chemistry.

Goal: generate data from tRNAseq workshop & write up a short manuscript describing:
* our method improvements to nanopore tRNA sequencing protocols (use of beads, optimizing molar ratios of ligations to reduce free adapter)
* the yield and basecalling accuracy improvements that result from adapting the protocol to RNA004 chemistry
* ability to capture mitochondrial tRNA (clear in our RNA002 data, not reported in the literature)
* leveraging tRNA as a way to systematically benchmarking differences in basecalling error signals produced by old vs. new nanopore dRNAseq chemistry
* comparison of select tRNA modification signals across bacteria, yeast, human tRNAs

Put out preprint & submit this to NAR in Jan 2024.
